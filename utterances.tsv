Robot Intro	Hello {0}.  |gesture(express_happy_surprise)| Thank you for joining our experiment today. My name is Joe bot, and I'm here to cooperate with you on completing some tasks.	Player		1	
General Intro	The first task is to place these |gaze(-0.8,-0.5,0.7)| square pieces flat on the |gaze(0,-0.4,0.6)| board, in a way that when lifted up  |gaze(0,-0.0,1.0)|  off the board, will form a perfect cube with 6 sides. <break strength="strong"/> Do you understand?	Player		1	
Rephrase Intro	The objective of the task is to assemble a perfect 6 sided cube with the square pieces, positioning them flat on the board. <break strength="medium"/> When the pieces are lifted up, you will have the 3D cube.  <break strength="strong"/> Is it clear now?	Player		1	
General Rule 1	Let's start by learning the rules for this task. <break strength="strong"/> The first rule is that all the pieces have to be placed flat on top of the printed squares on the board. <break strength="strong"/> Could you please place one of the pieces in any square on the board?	Player		1	
General Rule 2	Excellent, |gesture(smile)| <break strength="medium"/> Now, the second rule requires that all the pieces are connected to each other. There cannot be any gaps in between. <break strength="medium"/> Can you connect another piece to the one you placed before? <break strength="medium"/> You should hear a click when doing it.	Player		1	
Clear Example	Perfect. |gesture(smile)| Now. Please clear the board, so that we can start with our first round.	Player		1	
Rephrase Rule 1	Please put one piece flat on the board.	Player		1	
Rephrase Rule 1	The first rule requires that the pieces are placed flat on top of the printed squares on the board. Could you please place one of the pieces on the board?	Player		1	
Rephrase Rule 2	Please put a second piece on the board connected to the previous one.	Player		1	
Rephrase Rule 2	Please place a piece on the board. When placing new pieces on the board they must be connected to each other and you should hear a click.	Player		1	
Game Start	Great, |gesture(smile)| let's begin.  Please start assembling the cube with the square pieces. 	Player		1	This is a new dialogue act, not in the drop down menu.
Game Start	Good. |gesture(smile)| Please begin arranging the cube on the board.	Player		1	
Game Start	Excellent. |gesture(smile)|  You can start arranging the pieces on the board.	Player		1	
Intro to Round 1	Good. We will do three rounds of this activity with a different restriction in every round. <break strength="medium"/> In this round, we must use 4 squares in a line. Do you understand?	Player		1	1
Intro to Round 2	OK, now we are going to move on to the next round. <break strength="strong"/> In this round, we can only have a maximum of 3 squares in line. Are you ready?	Player		1	This is a new dialogue act, not in the drop down menu.
Intro to Round 3	Let's move on to round 3. <break strength="strong"/> In this round, there can not be more than 2 squares in line. Do you understand?	Player		1	
Rephrase Intro Round 1	In the first round we should use 4 pieces in line.	Player		1	
Rephrase Intro Round 1	For this round, we must use 4 squares in line.	Player		1	
Rephrase Intro Round 2	In this second round, we must use at least 3 squares in line, but not more.	Player		1	
Rephrase Intro Round 3	For this last round, we can only have a maximum of 2 squares in line.	Player		1	
Compliment	You're doing great, {0}.	Player	emotion_happy	1	How often should we say user's name?  5-10%
Reassurance	I believe |gesture(smile)| in you.	Player	emotion_happy	1	
Reassurance	You can |gesture(express_happy_surprise)| do this.	Player	emotion_happy	1	
Compliment	I think you are definitely on the right path!	Player	emotion_happy	1	
Compliment	You've |gesture(smile)| got this, {0}!	Player		1	
Good Quadrant	I think you are looking at the right place.	Quadrant		1	
Good Quadrant	That seems like the right direction.	Quadrant		1	
Good Quadrant	You are looking at the right place.	Quadrant		1	
Good Quadrant	Focusing on this area should bring us closer to a solution.	Quadrant	emotion_happy	1	
Good Quadrant	I would also place a piece in this section.	Quadrant		1	
Good Quadrant	I believe you are focusing on the right place.	Quadrant		1	
Good Quadrant	I think this is the |gesture(smile)| right area.	Quadrant		1	
Good Quadrant	Focusing on this area makes sense.	Quadrant		1	
Bad Quadrant	This does not seem like a good area to focus on.	Quadrant		1	
Bad Quadrant	I would not look |gesture(express_sad)| at that side of the board.	Quadrant		1	
Bad Quadrant	Placing a piece here |gesture(express_confused)| probably will not help us.	Quadrant		1	
Bad Quadrant	Focusing on this area is not likely to bring us closer to a solution.	Quadrant		1	
Bad Quadrant	I would not move a piece to that side of the board.	Quadrant		1	
Bad Quadrant	I would not look over there for  a solution.	Quadrant		1	
Bad Quadrant	I think you should look somewhere else! This area does not seem right!	Quadrant		1	
Bad Quadrant	Moving a piece to this area will probably not bring us closer to a solution.	Quadrant		1	
Bad Quadrant	|gesture(shake)|	Quadrant	emotion_sad	1	
Good	Yes, I agree. This move appears correct.	Square		1	Should robot always be certain? As in; 'This move is correct', not 'This move appears correct'
Good	Well done! |gesture(express_happy_surprise)| This move looks good.	Player		1	
Good	This move was very smart!	Player	emotion_happy	1	
Good	I could not have thought |gesture(express_happy_surprise)|of a better move myself!	Player		1	
Good	That move makes a lot of sense!	Player	emotion_happy	1	
Good	I think this move was the right decision.	Player		1

Reassurance	I am sure we will find the solution.	Player		1	
Compliment	i think you  |gesture(express_happy_surprise)| are doing great!	Player		1	
Compliment	You have got this!	Player	emotion_excited	1	
Reassurance	I am confident that we will find a solution very soon.	Player		1	
Reassurance	I believe that you |gesture(smile)|  are going to nail this.	Player		1	
Reassurance	This is a super  |gesture(brow_frown)| tricky task.	Player		1	
Reassurance	It is not so  |gesture(thoughtful)|easy to find a solution for this task.	Player		1	
Reassurance	This task looks |gesture(express_sad)| easier, than it  is.	Player		1	
Reassurance	I think it normally takes a a bit of time to solve this task.	Player		1	
Reassurance	It really is |gesture(thoughtful)| a hard task.	Player		1	
Bad Last Move	I don't think this move would lead to a correct solution.	Square	emotion_concerned	1	Robot again not 'certain' here. Using 'I don't think...'.  Sould robot be certain? 
Wrong Arrangement	|gesture(Frown)|	Square		1	
Bad Last Move	I would |gesture(express_confused)| reconsider this move.	Square		1	
Bad Last Move	That move will probably not bring us |gesture(thoughtful)| closer to a solution.	Square	emotion_sad	1	
Bad Color	The {1} piece here is not likely to help to find the solution.	Square	emotion_concerned	1	
Bad Last Move	No, I do not think so. |gesture(express_confused)| This move does not seem like a good choice.	Square	emotion_concerned	1	
Bad Last Move	This move does |gesture(brow_frown)| not make much sense.	Square		1
