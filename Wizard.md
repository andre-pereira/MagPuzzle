# Wizard Interface
The wizard interface was created in [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/) and the C# programming language is used for most of the scripting in the project.

## GameObjects
[GameObjects](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) are the baseclass for all objects in Unity3D and we used them to organize and divide our project.

### Speech Recognition
### Logging
### Furhat Robot
### ARToolkit
### Main Camera
These two gameobjects are present in most Unity3D projects. We use a simple camera 

### Canvas
#### Wizard Management
### GameBoard
#### Gaze

### RTVoice

The interface is able to follow MagPuzzle pieces as they move and the wizard that is controlling it is able to guide users towards a target solution.

## Speech Recognition
Speech recognition results from the user are drawn in a text box on the bottom-left of the interface. Intermediate speech recognition results or hypothesis are presented with a â€¦ punctuation at the end of the detected utterance and once the result is known the punctuation is removed. The result stays in the interface for a few more seconds or until a new recognition starts after detection of the end of utterance.
