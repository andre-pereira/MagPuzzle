![MagPuzzle Scenario Picture](scenario.png)

This application was designed and developed to study the effects of **responsive joint attention and mutual gaze** in Human-Robot Interaction. MagPuzzle is a spatial reasoning cooperative task where a life-like social robot interacts with human participants. Participants visualize a three-dimensional cube and reconstruct it by placing and manipulating six different colored puzzle pieces on a two-dimensional board with a 4X4 grid. The task is comprised of three different sub-tasks or puzzles, with increasing levels of difficulty, where the maximum amount of pieces in a line (row or column) allowed for the solution varies. The social robot cooperates with participants to arrive at solutions in all three different puzzles. The robot guides users towards a solution mostly by using non-deterministic speech and joint attention behavior.

## Repository
This repository contains different two different systems that are integrated in the MagPuzzle application.
1. [A perception restricted wizard interface for the MagPuzzle scenario.](Wizard.md)
2. [An autonomous responsive joint attention system.](ResponsiveGaze.md)

## Hardware
This application requires a set of magnetic puzzle pieces, a webcamera mounted on top of the MagPuzzle Board, and a camera compatible with GazeSense. We also recommend using a dual monitor setup for the wizard station.

## Additional Information
Please contact me in GitHub for more details about the Hardware setup or about any question regarding this repository.
