## GazeSense
GazeSense, a non-intrusive gaze and head direction tracker that can be used with the Kinect or RealSense cameras is also integrated in our application. We communicate with this gaze tracking software by using a TCP/IP connection within Unity3D. Gaze direction is then displayed in our interface by drawing two semi-opaque lines that represent the user's gaze. When the system detects that the user is gazing at a point of our board or at the robot, the lines change, and the wizard becomes aware of where the user is looking at. If no gaze is detected, the line is transformed into two simple dots that represent the eyes. Given some limitations in the performance of the GazeSense system we cannot distinguish individual squares in our board but rather four different quadrants each representing four squares (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). After performing pilot tests using our wizard-of-Oz system we decided to only use the head orientation data as an input for our gaze estimation. Currently, non-intrusive gaze detection algorithms that use a single camera to track the eye's pupil for gaze estimation require calibration and are not adequate for gaze that is directed towards a horizontal surface.
